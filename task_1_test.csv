t, One of the first groups of Puritans to move to North America , known as Pilgrims and led by William Bradford , had originally left England to live in the Netherlands .
t, Fearing their children were losing their English identity among the Dutch , however , they sailed for North America in 1620 to settle at Plymouth , the first English settlement in New England .
t, 2161 . In 1610 , Spanish settlers established themselves at Santa Fe — originally named La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de Asís , or “ Royal City of the Holy Faith of St. Francis of Assisi ” — where many Pueblo villages were located .
t, Santa Fe became the capital of the Kingdom of New Mexico , an outpost of the larger Spanish Viceroyalty of New Spain , which had its headquarters in Mexico City .
t, As they had in other Spanish colonies , Franciscan missionaries labored to bring about a spiritual conquest by converting the Pueblo to Catholicism .
t, At first , the Pueblo adopted the parts of Catholicism that dovetailed with their own long - standing view of the world .
t, 2170 . The war continued until 1763 , when the French signed the Treaty of Paris .
t, This treaty signaled a dramatic reversal of fortune for France .
t, 2197 . Henry replied that Virginians were subject only to taxes that they themselves — or their representatives — imposed .
t, In short , there could be no taxation without representation .
t, 2242 . The British would turn over the frontier posts in the Northwest , American ships would be allowed to trade freely in the West Indies , and the United States agreed to assemble a commission charged with settling colonial debts U.S. citizens owed British merchants .
t, The treaty did not address the important issue of impressment , however — the British navy ’s practice of forcing or “ impressing ” American sailors to work and fight on British warships .
t, Jay ’s Treaty led the Spanish , who worried that it signaled an alliance between the United States and Great Britain , to negotiate a treaty of their own — Pinckney ’s Treaty — that allowed American commerce to flow through the Spanish port of New Orleans .
t, 2496 . Named for Charles Ponzi , the original “ Ponzi schemes ” emerged early in the 1920s to encourage novice investors to divert funds to unfounded ventures , which in reality simply used new investors ’ funds to pay off older investors as the schemes grew in size .
t, Speculation , where investors purchased into high - risk schemes that they hoped would pay off quickly , became the norm .
t, Several banks , including deposit institutions that originally avoided investment loans , began to offer easy credit , allowing people to invest , even when they lacked the money to do so .
t, 2505 . One such incident was the case of the Scottsboro Boys ( [ link ] ) .
t, In 1931 , nine black boys , who had been riding the rails , were arrested for vagrancy and disorderly conduct after an altercation with some white travelers on the train .
t, 2517 . On March 12 , the day before the banks were set to reopen , Roosevelt held his first “ fireside chat ” ( [ link ] ) .
t, In this initial radio address to the American people , he explained what the bank examiners had been doing over the previous week .
t, 2647 . In this module , we first re - examine how to add velocities and then consider certain aspects of what relative velocity means .
t, How do we add velocities ?
t, Velocity is a vector ( it has both magnitude and direction ) ; the rules of vector addition discussed in Vector Addition and Subtraction : Graphical Methods and Vector Addition and Subtraction : Analytical Methods apply to the addition of velocities , just as they do for any other vectors .
t, In one - dimensional motion , the addition of velocities is simple — they add like ordinary numbers .
t, 2749 . In such a frame of reference , Newton ’s laws of motion take the form given in Dynamics : Newton 's Laws of Motion The car is a non - inertial frame of reference because it is accelerated to the side .
t, The force to the left sensed by car passengers is a fictitious force having no physical origin .
t, There is nothing real pushing them left — the car , as well as the driver , is actually accelerating to the right .
t, Let us now take a mental ride on a merry - go - round — specifically , a rapidly rotating playground merry - go - round .
t, 2752 . It is always attractive , and it depends only on the masses involved and the distance between them .
t, Stated in modern language , Newton ’s universal law of gravitation states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force along a line joining them .
t, The force is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them .
t, 3052 . Mutual inductance is the effect of Faraday ’s law of induction for one device upon another , such as the primary coil in transmitting energy to the secondary in a transformer .
t, See [ link ] , where simple coils induce emfs in one another . These coils can induce emfs in one another like an inefficient transformer .
t, 3079 . It was later found that these discharges created an invisible , penetrating form of very high frequency electromagnetic radiation .
t, This radiation was called an X - ray , because its identity and nature were unknown .
t, 3082 . This is true for waves on guitar strings , for water waves , and for sound waves , where amplitude is proportional to pressure .
t, In electromagnetic waves , the amplitude is the maximum field strength of the electric and magnetic fields .
t, ( See [ link ] . )
t, 3085 . This is because light coming from the fish to us changes direction when it leaves the tank , and in this case , it can travel two different paths to get to our eyes .
t, The changing of a light ray ’s direction ( loosely called bending ) when it passes through variations in matter is called refraction .
t, Refraction is responsible for a tremendous range of optical phenomena , from the action of lenses to voice transmission through optical fibers .

t, 3259 . Why did n’t it have a counterpart ?
t, A fourth quark flavor called charm ( c ) was proposed as the counterpart of the strange quark to make things symmetric — there would be two normal quarks ( u and d ) and two exotic quarks ( s and c ) .
t, Furthermore , at that time only four leptons were known , two normal and two exotic .
t, 2640 . If an object moves relative to a reference frame ( for example , if a professor moves to the right relative to a white board or a passenger moves toward the rear of an airplane ) , then the object ’s position changes .
t, This change in position is known as displacement .
t, The word “ displacement ” implies that an object has moved , or has been displaced .
t, 2913 . The most obvious method of obtaining better detail is to utilize shorter wavelengths .
t, Ultraviolet ( UV ) microscopes have been constructed with special lenses that transmit UV rays and utilize photographic or electronic techniques to record images .
t, The shorter UV wavelengths allow somewhat greater detail to be observed , but drawbacks , such as the hazard of UV to living tissue and the need for special detection devices and lenses ( which tend to be dispersive in the UV ) , severely limit the use of UV microscopes .
t, 2916 . Another type of microscope utilizing wave interference and differences in phases to enhance contrast is called the phase - contrast microscope .
t, While its principle is the same as the interference microscope , the phase - contrast microscope is simpler to use and construct .

t, 3060 . We can get a good understanding of electromagnetic waves ( EM ) by considering how they are produced .
t, Whenever a current varies , associated electric and magnetic fields vary , moving out from the source like waves .
t, 3090 . ( The axis is defined to be a line normal to the lens at its center , as shown in [ link ] . )
t, Such a lens is called a converging ( or convex ) lens for the converging effect it has on light rays .
t, An expanded view of the path of one ray through the lens is shown , to illustrate how the ray changes direction both as it enters and as it leaves the lens .
t, 3102 . Less diverging rays from a distant object can be converged for a clear image .
t, The distance to the closest object that can be seen clearly is called the near point of the eye ( normally 25 cm ) .
t, ( a ) The nearsighted ( myopic ) eye converges rays from a distant object in front of the retina ; thus , they are diverging when they strike the retina , producing a blurry image .
t, This can be caused by the lens of the eye being too powerful or the length of the eye being too great .
t, 3105 . These are the rainbow of colors produced when white light is dispersed according to different wavelengths .
t, There are thousands of other hues that we can perceive .
t, These include brown , teal , gold , pink , and white .
t, 3144 . An ideal radiator is one that has an emissivity of 1 at all wavelengths and , thus , is jet black .
t, Ideal radiators are therefore called blackbodies , and their EM radiation is called blackbody radiation .
t, It was discussed that the total intensity of the radiation varies as T4 , T4 , size 12 { T rSup { size 8 { 4 } } } { } the fourth power of the absolute temperature of the body , and that the peak of the spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths at higher temperatures .
t, 3150 . This decelerating process produces radiation that is called bremsstrahlung ( German for braking radiation ) .
t, The second feature is the existence of sharp peaks in the spectrum ; these are called characteristic x rays , since they are characteristic of the anode material .
t, Characteristic x rays come from atomic excitations unique to a given type of anode material .
t, 3159 . There is another form of Heisenberg ’s uncertainty principle for simultaneous measurements of energy and time .
t, In equation form , ΔE Δt ≥ h 4 π , ΔE Δt ≥ h 4 π , size 12 { ΔE Δt > = { { h } over { 4 π } } } { } where ΔE ΔE size 12 { ΔE } { } is the uncertainty in energy and Δt Δt size 12 { Δt } { } is the uncertainty in time .
t, 3189 . It was soon evident that Becquerel ’s rays originate in the nuclei of the atoms and have other unique characteristics .
t, The emission of these rays is called nuclear radioactivity or simply radioactivity .
t, The rays themselves are called nuclear radiation .
t, 3294 . We have noted in Particles , Patterns , and Conservation Laws that there are three flavors of neutrinos ( ν e ν e size 12 { ν rSub { size 8 { e } } } { } , v μ v μ size 12 { v rSub { size 8 { μ } } } { } , and v τ v τ size 12 { v rSub { size 8 { τ } } } { } ) and that the weak interaction could change quark flavor .
t, It should also change neutrino flavor — that is , any type of neutrino could change spontaneously into any other , a process called neutrino oscillations .
t, However , this can occur only if neutrinos have a mass .
t, 2681 . There are two major systems of units used in the world : SI units ( also known as the metric system ) and English units ( also known as the customary or imperial system ) .
t, English units were historically used in nations once ruled by the British Empire and are still widely used in the United States .
t, 2948 . Drawings using lines to represent electric fields around charged objects are very useful in visualizing field strength and direction .

t, 3119 . An interesting thing happens if you pass light through a large number of evenly spaced parallel slits , called a diffraction grating .
t, An interference pattern is created that is very similar to the one formed by a double slit ( see [ link ] ) .
t, 3140 . Rest energy is
t, 3275 . Before that time is the TOE epoch , but we have almost no idea as to the nature of the universe then , since we have no workable theory of quantum gravity .
t, We call the hypothetical unified force superforce . Now let us imagine starting at TOE and moving forward in time to see what type of universe is created from various events along the way .
t, As temperatures and average energies decrease with expansion , the universe reaches the stage where average particle separations are large enough to see differences between the strong and electroweak forces ( at about 10 − 35 s 10 − 35 s size 12 { " 10 " rSup { size 8 { - " 35 " } } ` s } { } ) .
t, 3331 . Some disagree with this theory and argue that genes do not set a limit on a person ’s potential .
t, Another perspective on the interaction between genes and the environment is the concept of genetic environmental correlation .
t, Stated simply , our genes influence our environment , and our environment influences the expression of our genes ( [ link ] ) .
t, 3337 . Learning how the cells and organs ( like the brain ) function , help us understand the biological basis behind human psychology .
t, The nervous system is composed of two basic cell types : glial cells ( also known as glia ) and neurons .
t, Glial cells , which outnumber neurons ten to one , are traditionally thought to play a supportive role to neurons , both physically and metabolically .
t, 3652 . In addition to maintaining balance , the vestibular system collects information critical for controlling movement and the reflexes that move various parts of our bodies to compensate for changes in body position .
t, Therefore , both proprioception ( perception of body position ) and kinesthesia ( perception of the body ’s movement through space ) interact with information provided by the vestibular system .
t, 3655 . Another Gestalt principle for organizing sensory stimuli into meaningful perception is proximity .
t, This principle asserts that things that are close to one another tend to be grouped together , as [ link ] illustrates .
t, 3664 . They tend to be simpler than instincts , involve the activity of specific body parts and systems ( e.g. , the knee - jerk reflex and the contraction of the pupil in bright light ) , and involve more primitive centers of the central nervous system ( e.g. , the spinal cord and the medulla ) .
t, In contrast , instincts are innate behaviors that are triggered by a broader range of events , such as aging and the change of seasons .
t, They are more complex patterns of behavior , involve movement of the organism as a whole ( e.g. , sexual activity and migration ) , and involve higher brain centers .
t, 3676 . Now that you know how classical conditioning works and have seen several examples , let ’s take a look at some of the general processes involved .
t, In classical conditioning , the initial period of learning is known as acquisition , when an organism learns to connect a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus .
t, During acquisition , the neutral stimulus begins to elicit the conditioned response , and eventually the neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus capable of eliciting the conditioned response by itself .
t, 3745 . THEORIES ABOUT MOTIVATION William James ( 1842 – 1910 ) was an important contributor to early research into motivation , and he is often referred to as the father of psychology in the United States .
t, James theorized that behavior was driven by a number of instincts , which aid survival ( [ link ] ) .
t, 3751 . Self - efficacy is an individual ’s belief in her own capability to complete a task , which may include a previous successful completion of the exact task or a similar task .
t, Albert Bandura ( 1994 ) theorized that an individual ’s sense of self - efficacy plays a pivotal role in motivating behavior .
t, Bandura argues that motivation derives from expectations that we have about the consequences of our behaviors , and ultimately , it is the appreciation of our capacity to engage in a given behavior that will determine what we do and the future goals that we set for ourselves .
t, 3754 . You use crystallized intelligence all the time in your coursework by demonstrating that you have mastered the information covered in the course .
t, Fluid intelligence encompasses the ability to see complex relationships and solve problems .
t, Navigating your way home after being detoured onto an unfamiliar route because of road construction would draw upon your fluid intelligence .
t, 3763 . Creativity is often assessed as a function of one ’s ability to engage in divergent thinking .
t, Divergent thinking can be described as thinking “ outside the box ; ” it allows an individual to arrive at unique , multiple solutions to a given problem .
t, 3805 . The James - Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotions arise from physiological arousal .
t, Recall what you have learned about the sympathetic nervous system and our fight or flight response when threatened .
t, 3823 . Sigmund Freud ( 1856 – 1939 ) is probably the most controversial and misunderstood psychological theorist .
t, When reading Freud ’s theories , it is important to remember that he was a medical doctor , not a psychologist .
t, 3826 . Through social interactions with parents and others in a child ’s environment , the ego and superego develop to help control the i d .
t, The superego develops as a child interacts with others , learning the social rules for right and wrong .
t, The superego acts as our conscience ; it is our moral compass that tells us how we should behave .
t, 3832 . In the above example , Joe made fun of a homosexual peer while himself being attracted to males .
t, In regression , an individual acts much younger than their age .
t, For example , a four - year - old child who resents the arrival of a newborn sibling may act like a baby and revert to drinking out of a bottle .
t, 3922 . They view development as a lifelong process that can be studied scientifically across three developmental domains — physical , cognitive , and psychosocial development .
t, Physical development involves growth and changes in the body and brain , the senses , motor skills , and health and wellness .
t, Cognitive development involves learning , attention , memory , language , thinking , reasoning , and creativity .
t, 3940 . When children learn new information , they adjust their schemata through two processes : assimilation and accommodation .
t, First , they assimilate new information or experiences in terms of their current schemata : assimilation is when they take in information that is comparable to what they already know .
t, Accommodation describes when they change their schemata based on new information .
t, 4078 . The branch of I - O psychology known as industrial psychology focuses on identifying and matching persons to tasks within an organization .
t, This involves job analysis , which means accurately describing the task or job .
t, Then , organizations must identify the characteristics of applicants for a match to the job analysis .
t, 4114 . The scientific study of how stress and other psychological factors impact health falls within the realm of health psychology , a subfield of psychology devoted to understanding the importance of psychological influences on health , illness , and how people respond when they become ill ( Taylor , 1999 ) .
t, Health psychology emerged as a discipline in the 1970s , a time during which there was increasing awareness of the role behavioral and lifestyle factors play in the development of illnesses and diseases ( Straub , 2007 ) .
t, 4249 . Bipolar and related disorders are a group of disorders in which mania is the defining feature .
t, Mania is a state of extreme elation and agitation .
t, When people experience mania , they may become extremely talkative , behave recklessly , or attempt to take on many tasks simultaneously .
t, 3618 . An example of a monocular cue would be what is known as linear perspective .
t, Linear perspective refers to the fact that we perceive depth when we see two parallel lines that seem to converge in an image ( [ link ] ) .
t, Some other monocular depth cues are interposition , the partial overlap of objects , and the relative size and closeness of images to the horizon .
t, 3798 . The correlations of IQs of unrelated versus related persons reared apart or together suggest a genetic component to intelligence .
t, The bottom is labeled “ Percent IQ Correlation ” and the left side is labeled “ Relationship . ”
t, The percent IQ Correlation for relationships where no genes are shared , including adoptive parent - child pairs , similarly aged unrelated children raised together , and adoptive siblings are around 21 percent , 30 percent , and 32 percent , respectively .
t, 3801 . Dyslexia is the most common learning disability in children .
t, An individual with dyslexia exhibits an inability to correctly process letters .
t, The neurological mechanism for sound processing does not work properly in someone with dyslexia .
t, 3804 . Our emotional states are combinations of physiological arousal , psychological appraisal , and subjective experiences .
t, Together , these are known as the components of emotion .
t, These appraisals are informed by our experiences , backgrounds , and cultures .
t, 3831 . Another defense mechanism is reaction formation , in which someone expresses feelings , thoughts , and behaviors opposite to their inclinations .
t, In the above example , Joe made fun of a homosexual peer while himself being attracted to males .
t, 4221 . Depersonalization is defined as feelings of “ unreality or detachment from , or unfamiliarity with , one ’s whole self or from aspects of the self ” ( APA , 2013 , p. 302 ) .
t, Individuals who experience depersonalization might believe their thoughts and feelings are not their own ; they may feel robotic as though they lack control over their movements and speech ; they may experience a distorted sense of time and , in extreme cases , they may sense an “ out - of - body ” experience in which they see themselves from the vantage point of another person .
t, Derealization is conceptualized as a sense of “ unreality or detachment from , or unfamiliarity with , the world , be it individuals , inanimate objects , or all surroundings ” ( APA , 2013 , p. 303 ) .
t, 4227 . A person with schizophrenia may believe that his mother is plotting with the FBI to poison his coffee , or that his neighbor is an enemy spy who wants to kill him .
t, These kinds of delusions are known as paranoid delusions , which involve the ( false ) belief that other people or agencies are plotting to harm the person .
t, People with schizophrenia also may hold grandiose delusions , beliefs that one holds special power , unique knowledge , or is extremely important .
t, 4266 . Rather , obsessions are characterized as persistent , unintentional , and unwanted thoughts and urges that are highly intrusive , unpleasant , and distressing ( APA , 2013 ) .
t, Common obsessions include concerns about germs and contamination , doubts ( “ Did I turn the water off ? ” ) , order and symmetry ( “ I need all the spoons in the tray to be arranged a certain way ” ) , and urges that are aggressive or lustful .
t, Usually , the person knows that such thoughts and urges are irrational and thus tries to suppress or ignore them , but has an extremely difficult time doing so .
t, 3647 . In addition to the receptors located in the skin , there are also a number of free nerve endings that serve sensory functions .
t, These nerve endings respond to a variety of different types of touch - related stimuli and serve as sensory receptors for both thermoception ( temperature perception ) and nociception ( a signal indicating potential harm and maybe pain ) ( Garland , 2012 ; Petho & Reeh , 2012 ; Spray , 1986 ) .
t, Sensory information collected from the receptors and free nerve endings travels up the spinal cord and is transmitted to regions of the medulla , thalamus , and ultimately to somatosensory cortex , which is located in the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe .
t, 3743 . What motivations underlie our behaviors ?
t, Motivation describes the wants or needs that direct behavior toward a goal .
t, In addition to biological motives , motivations can be intrinsic ( arising from internal factors ) or extrinsic ( arising from external factors ) ( [ link ] ) .
t, 3959 . Research suggests that they do not .
t, People from an individualistic culture , that is , a culture that focuses on individual achievement and autonomy , have the greatest tendency to commit the fundamental attribution error .
t, Individualistic cultures , which tend to be found in western countries such as the United States , Canada , and the United Kingdom , promote a focus on the individual .
t, 3983 . Finally , children with disorganized attachment behaved oddly in the Strange Situation .

t, 4067 . Do you voluntarily help others ?
t, Voluntary behavior with the intent to help other people is called prosocial behavior .
t, Why do people help other people ?
t, 4259 . Cognitive theories of depression take the view that depression is triggered by negative thoughts , interpretations , self - evaluations , and expectations ( Joormann , 2009 ) .
t, These diathesis - stress models propose that depression is triggered by a “ cognitive vulnerability ” ( negative and maladaptive thinking ) and by precipitating stressful life events ( Gotlib & Joormann , 2010 ) .
t, Perhaps the most well - known cognitive theory of depression was developed in the 1960s by psychiatrist Aaron Beck , based on clinical observations and supported by research ( Beck , 2008 ) .
t, 4280 . As is the case with other anxiety disorders , the panic attacks can not result from the physiological effects of drugs and other substances , a medical condition , or another mental disorder .
t, A panic attack is defined as a period of extreme fear or discomfort that develops abruptly and reaches a peak within 10 minutes .
t, Its symptoms include accelerated heart rate , sweating , trembling , choking sensations , hot flashes or chills , dizziness or lightheadedness , fears of losing control or going crazy , and fears of dying ( APA , 2013 ) .
t, 4283 . Alex suffers from generalized anxiety disorder : a relatively continuous state of excessive , uncontrollable , and pointless worry and apprehension .
t, People with generalized anxiety disorder often worry about routine , everyday things , even though their concerns are unjustified ( [ link ] ) .
t, 4326 . A good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram , which is shown in [ link ] .
t, It pictures the economy as consisting of two groups — households and firms — that interact in two markets : the goods and services market in which firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees .
t, 4341 . The budget constraint framework helps to emphasize that most choices in the real world are not about getting all of one thing or all of another ; that is , they are not about choosing either the point at one end of the budget constraint or else the point all the way at the other end .
t, Instead , most choices involve marginal analysis , which means comparing the benefits and costs of choosing a little more or a little less of a good .
t, 4347 . The budget constraints presented earlier in this chapter , showing individual choices about what quantities of goods to consume , were all straight lines .
t, The reason for these straight lines was that the slope of the budget constraint was determined by relative prices of the two goods in the consumption budget constraint .
t, However , the production possibilities frontier for healthcare and education was drawn as a curved line .
t, 4359 . Consumers who are looking for the best deals will encourage businesses to offer goods and services that meet their needs .
t, Adam Smith , writing in The Wealth of Nations , christened this property the invisible hand .
t, In describing how consumers and producers interact in a market economy , Smith wrote :
t, 4398 . A firm can build new factories and purchase new machinery , or it can close existing facilities .
t, In planning for the long run , the firm will compare alternative production technologies ( or processes ) .
t, 4641 . Redistribution means taking income from those with higher incomes and providing income to those with lower incomes .
t, Earlier in this chapter , we considered some of the key government policies that provide support for the poor : the welfare program TANF , the earned income tax credit , SNAP , and Medicaid .
t, 5226 . In the early 1990s , the United States was negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) with Mexico , an agreement that reduced tariffs , import quotas , and nontariff barriers to trade between the United States , Mexico , and Canada .
t, H. Ross Perot , a 1992 candidate for U.S. president , claimed , in prominent campaign arguments , that if the United States expanded trade with Mexico , there would be a “ giant sucking sound ” as U.S. employers relocated to Mexico to take advantage of lower wages .
t, 5253 . Growth rates are frequently encountered in real world economics .
t, A growth rate is simply the percentage change in some quantity .
t, It could be your income .
t, 5277 . Each person who receives an additional dollar faces this choice .
t, The marginal propensity to consume ( MPC ) , is the share of the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to consumption expenditures .
t, The marginal propensity to save ( MPS ) is the share of the additional dollar a person decides to save .
t, 4637 . One set of explanations focuses on the changing shape of American households ; the other focuses on greater inequality of wages , what some economists call “ winner take all ” labor markets .
t, We will begin with how we measure inequality , and then consider the explanations for growing inequality in the United States .
t, Measuring Income Distribution by Quintiles
t, One common way of measuring income inequality is to rank all households by income , from lowest to highest , and then to divide all households into five groups with equal numbers of people , known as quintiles .
t, This calculation allows for measuring the distribution of income among the five groups compared to the total .
t, 4655 . [ link ] shows the average wage of black workers as a ratio of the average wage of white workers and the average wage of female workers as a ratio of the average wage of male workers .
t, Research by the economists Francine Blau and Laurence Kahn shows that the gap between the earnings of women and men did not move much in the 1970s , but has declined since the 1980s .
t, According to the U.S. Census , the gap between the earnings of blacks and whites diminished in the 1970s , but has not changed in 50 years .
t, 4673 . There is a lot of human behavior out there that mainstream economists have tended to call “ irrational ” since it is consistently at odds with economists ’ utility maximizing models .
t, The typical response is for economists to brush these behaviors aside and call them “ anomalies ” or unexplained quirks .
t, 4700 . The U.S. insurance industry is primarily regulated at the state level ; indeed , since 1871 there has been a National Association of Insurance Commissioners that brings together these state regulators to exchange information and strategies .
t, The state insurance regulators typically attempt to accomplish two things : to keep the price of insurance low and to make sure that everyone has insurance .
t, 4709 . A bond is a financial contract : a borrower agrees to repay the amount that was borrowed and also a rate of interest over a period of time in the future .
t, A corporate bond is issued by firms , but bonds are also issued by various levels of government .
t, For example , a municipal bond is issued by cities , a state bond by U.S. states , and a Treasury bond by the federal government through the U.S .
t, 4784 . The process by which capital ages and loses value is called depreciation .
t, The NNP can be further subdivided into national income , which includes all income to businesses and individuals , and personal income , which includes only income to people .
t, 4799 . “ Standard of living ” is a broader term than GDP .
t, While GDP focuses on production that is bought and sold in markets , standard of living includes all elements that affect people ’s well - being , whether they are bought and sold in the market or not .
t, To illuminate the gap between GDP and standard of living , it is useful to spell out some things that GDP does not cover that are clearly relevant to standard of living .
t, 4808 . The first determinant of labor productivity is human capital .
t, Human capital is the accumulated knowledge ( from education and experience ) , skills , and expertise that the average worker in an economy possesses .
t, Typically the higher the average level of education in an economy , the higher the accumulated human capital and the higher the labor productivity .
t, 4408 . An example from the market for gasoline can be shown in the form of a table or a graph .
t, A table that shows the quantity demanded at each price , such as [ link ] , is called a demand schedule .
t, Price in this case is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline .
t, 4639 . The most plausible explanation is that while the explosion in new information and communications technologies over the last several decades has helped many workers to become more productive , the benefits have been especially great for high - skilled workers like top business managers , consultants , and design professionals .
t, The new technologies have also helped to encourage globalization , the remarkable increase in international trade over the last few decades , by making it more possible to learn about and coordinate economic interactions all around the world .
t, In turn , the rising impact of foreign trade in the U.S. economy has opened up greater opportunities for high - skilled workers to sell their services around the world .
t, 4660 . The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 prohibited discrimination on the basis of age against individuals who are 40 years of age or older .
t, The Civil Rights Act of 1991 provides monetary damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination .
t, The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 was aimed at prohibiting discrimination against women in the workplace who are planning to get pregnant , are pregnant , or are returning after pregnancy .
t, 4699 . Rather than face such a situation of adverse selection , the insurance company may decide not to sell insurance in this market at all .
t, If an insurance market is to exist , then one of two things must happen .
t, 4747 . Indeed , these reasons are probably tied together , since people who do not believe their vote matters will not bother to become informed or care who wins .
t, Economists have suggested why a utility - maximizing person might rationally decide not to vote or not to become informed about the election .
t, While a few elections in very small towns may be decided by a single vote , in most elections of any size , the margin of victory is measured in hundreds , thousands , or even millions of votes .
t, 4756 . In the battle over passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , which became known as “ Obamacare , ” there was heavy lobbying on all sides by insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies .
t, However , a lobby group , Health Care for America Now ( HCAN ) , was financed by labor unions and community groups and was organized to offset corporate lobbying .
t, 4774 . The gap between exports and imports is called the trade balance .
t, If a country ’s exports are larger than its imports , then a country is said to have a trade surplus .
t, In the United States , exports typically exceeded imports in the 1960s and 1970s , as shown in [ link ] ( b ) .
t, 4780 . To avoid this problem , which would overstate the size of the economy considerably , government statisticians count just the value of final goods and services in the chain of production that are sold for consumption , investment , government , and trade purposes .
t, Intermediate goods , which are goods that go into the production of other goods , are excluded from GDP calculations .
t, From the example above , only the value of the Ford truck will be counted .
t, 4936 . The AD / AS model can convey a number of interlocking relationships between the four macroeconomic goals of growth , unemployment , inflation , and a sustainable balance of trade .
t, Moreover , the AD / AS framework is flexible enough to accommodate both the Keynes ’ law approach that focuses on aggregate demand and the short run , while also including the Say ’s law approach that focuses on aggregate supply and the long run .
t, 4951 . What Determines Net Exports?Recall that exports are products produced domestically and sold abroad while imports are products produced abroad but purchased domestically .
t, Since aggregate demand is defined as spending on domestic goods and services , export expenditures add to AD , while import expenditures subtract from AD .
t, 5101 . First , PPP exchange rates are often used for international comparison of GDP and other economic statistics .
t, Imagine that you are preparing a table showing the size of GDP in many countries in several recent years , and for ease of comparison , you are converting all the values into U.S. dollars .
t, When you insert the value for Japan , you need to use a yen / dollar exchange rate .
t, 5131 . [ link ] also shows the patterns of taxation for the main categories of taxes levied by the federal government : individual income taxes , corporate income taxes , and social insurance and retirement receipts .
t, When most people think of taxes levied by the federal government , the first tax that comes to mind is the individual income tax that is due every year on April 15 ( or the first business day after ) .
t, The personal income tax is the largest single source of federal government revenue , but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue .
t, The second largest source of federal revenue is the payroll tax ( captured in social insurance and retirement receipts ) , which provides funds for Social Security and Medicare .
t, 5143 . [ link ] illustrates the process by using an aggregate demand / aggregate supply diagram in a growing economy .
t, The original equilibrium occurs at E0 , the intersection of aggregate demand curve AD0 and aggregate supply curve SRAS0 , at an output level of 200 and a price level of 90.One year later , aggregate supply has shifted to the right to SRAS1 in the process of long - term economic growth , and aggregate demand has also shifted to the right to AD1 , keeping the economy operating at the new level of potential GDP .
t, The new equilibrium ( E1 ) is an output level of 206 and a price level of 92 .
t, 5146 . Each year , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) calculates the standardized employment budget — that is , what the budget deficit or surplus would be if the economy were producing at potential GDP , where people who look for work were finding jobs in a reasonable period of time and businesses were making normal profits , with the result that both workers and businesses would be earning more and paying more taxes .
t, In effect , the standardized employment deficit eliminates the impact of the automatic stabilizers .
t, 5206 . Specialization in the world economy can be very finely split .
t, In fact , recent years have seen a trend in international trade called splitting up the value chain .
t, The value chain describes how a good is produced in stages .
t, 5209 . For example , a single large automobile factory could probably supply all the cars purchased in a smaller economy like the United Kingdom or Belgium in a given year .
t, However , if a country has only one or two large factories producing cars , and no international trade , then consumers in that country would have relatively little choice between kinds of cars ( other than the color of the paint and other nonessential options ) .
t, Little or no competition will exist between different car manufacturers .
t, 5310 . Interactionist sociologist Clark McPhail ( 1991 ) developed assembling perspective , another system for understanding collective behavior that credited individuals in crowds as rational beings .
t, Unlike previous theories , this theory refocuses attention from collective behavior to collective action .
t, 5316 . The latter is still in existence despite government involvement that led to the deaths of numerous Branch Davidian members in 1993 .
t, Alternative movements are focused on self - improvement and limited , specific changes to individual beliefs and behavior .
t, These include trends like transcendental meditation or a macrobiotic diet .
t, 5607 . We see the emergence of global assembly lines , where products are assembled over the course of several international transactions .
t, For instance , Apple designs its next - generation Mac prototype in the United States , components are made in various peripheral nations , they are then shipped to another peripheral nation such as Malaysia for assembly , and tech support is outsourced to India .
t, Globalization has also led to the development of global commodity chains , where internationally integrated economic links connect workers and corporations for the purpose of manufacture and marketing ( Plahe 2005 ) .
t, For example , in maquiladoras , mostly found in northern Mexico , workers may sew imported precut pieces of fabric into garments . Globalization also brings an international division of labor , in which comparatively wealthy workers from core nations compete with the low - wage labor pool of peripheral and semi - peripheral nations .
t, 5736 . Swedish sociologist Lars Tornstam developed a symbolic interactionist theory called gerotranscendence : the idea that as people age , they transcend the limited views of life they held in earlier times .
t, Tornstam believes that throughout the aging process , the elderly become less self - centered and feel more peaceful and connected to the natural world .
t, 5742 . One Partner or Many?People in the United States typically equate marriage with monogamy , when someone is married to only one person at a time .
t, In many countries and cultures around the world , however , having one spouse is not the only form of marriage .
t, 5414 . There are two ways to come across an innovative object or idea : discover it or invent it .
t, Discoveries make known previously unknown but existing aspects of reality .
t, In 1610 , when Galileo looked through his telescope and discovered Saturn , the planet was already there , but until then , no one had known about it .
t, 5417 . As a result , world markets became dominated by multinational companies in the 1980s , a new state of affairs at that time .
t, We have since come to refer to this integration of international trade and finance markets as globalization .
t, Increased communications and air travel have further opened doors for international business relations , facilitating the flow not only of goods but also of information and people as well ( Scheuerman 2014 ( revised ) ) .
t, 5426 . Postindustrial Society
t, Information societies , sometimes known as postindustrial or digital societies , are a recent development .
t, Unlike industrial societies that are rooted in the production of material goods , information societies are based on the production of information and services .
t, Digital technology is the steam engine of information societies , and computer moguls such as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are its John D. Rockefellers and Cornelius Vanderbilts .
t, 5630 . Though social conformities still exist that encourage people to choose partners within their own class , people are not as pressured to choose marriage partners based solely on those elements .
t, Marriage to a partner from the same social background is an endogamous union .
t, 5663 . Just as in the pre - Civil War United States , these humans are at the mercy of their employers .
t, Chattel slavery , the form of slavery once practiced in the American South , occurs when one person owns another as property .
t, Child slavery , which may include child prostitution , is a form of chattel slavery .
t, 5693 . It is thought that her secretary supported this practice by suggestions to Ginsberg that “ those nine men ” ( the other Supreme Court justices ) , “ hear that word and their first association is not the way you want them to be thinking ” ( Case 1995 ) .
t, This anecdote reveals that both sex and gender are actually socially defined variables whose definitions change over time .
t, Sexual Orientation
t, A person ’s sexual orientation is his or her physical , mental , emotional , and sexual attraction to a particular sex ( male or female ) .
t, Sexual orientation is typically divided into four categories : heterosexuality , the attraction to individuals of the other sex ; homosexuality , the attraction to individuals of the same sex ; bisexuality , the attraction to individuals of either sex ; and asexuality , no attraction to either sex .
t, 5317 . These include trends like transcendental meditation or a macrobiotic diet .
t, Resistance movements seek to prevent or undo change to the social structure .
t, The Ku Klux Klan , the Minutemen , and pro - life movements fall into this category .
t, 5491 . Mass media distribute impersonal information to a wide audience , via television , newspapers , radio , and the Internet .
t, With the average person spending over four hours a day in front of the television ( and children averaging even more screen time ) , media greatly influences social norms ( Roberts , Foehr , and Rideout 2005 ) .
t, 5539 . The student is reprimanded frequently by teachers and school staff , and soon enough , he develops a reputation as a “ troublemaker . ”
t, As a result , the student starts acting out even more and breaking more rules ; he has adopted the “ troublemaker ” label and embraced this deviant identity .
t, Secondary deviance can be so strong that it bestows a master status on an individual .
t, A master status is a label that describes the chief characteristic of an individual .
t, 5542 . In hindsight , we recognize that the laws that deemed many of their actions crimes — for instance , Rosa Parks taking a seat in the “ whites only ” section of the bus — were inconsistent with social equality .
t, As you have learned , all societies have informal and formal ways of maintaining social control .
t, Within these systems of norms , societies have legal codes that maintain formal social control through laws , which are rules adopted and enforced by a political authority .
t, Those who violate these rules incur negative formal sanctions .
t, 5713 . There are several reasons why the United States is graying so rapidly .
t, One of these is life expectancy : the average number of years a person born today may expect to live .
t, When we review Census Bureau statistics grouping the elderly by age , it is clear that in the United States , at least , we are living longer .
t, 5764 . A sect is a small and relatively new group .
t, Most of the well - known Christian denominations in the United States today began as sects .
t, 5791 . A more modern form of traditional authority is patrimonialism , which is traditional domination facilitated by an administration and military that are purely personal instruments of the master ( Eisenberg 1998 ) .
t, In this form of authority , all officials are personal favorites appointed by the ruler .
t, 5844 . His mother ’s complaints to the New York City Housing Authority were largely ignored .
t, In high school , Torres decided to become a lawyer , participated in mock trials , and met a young and aspiring local politician named James Vacca .
t, After graduation , he volunteered to campaign for Vacca in his run for a seat on the City Council .
t, 5847 . While some Americans disapprove of partisanship in general , others are put off by the ideology — established beliefs and ideals that help shape political policy — of one of the major parties .
t, This is especially true among the young .
t, 5856 . For instance , Virginia established its House of Burgesses in 1619 .
t, Upon their arrival in North America a year later , the English Separatists who settled the Plymouth Colony , commonly known as the Pilgrims , promptly authored the Mayflower Compact , an agreement to govern themselves according to the laws created by the male voters of the colony .
t, Nathaniel Philbrick .
t, 2006 .
t, 5961 . When economic times are good , such grants help states , cities , municipalities , and townships carry out their regular functions .
t, However , during hard economic times , such as the Great Recession of 2007 – 2009 , intergovernmental transfers provide much - needed fiscal relief as the revenue streams of state and local governments dry up .
t, During the Great Recession , tax receipts dropped as business activities slowed , consumer spending dropped , and family incomes decreased due to layoffs or work - hour reductions .
t, 5988 . In the late 1800s , some states attempted to regulate working conditions .
t, For example , New York State passed the Bakeshop Act in 1897 , which prohibited bakery employees from working more than sixty hours in a week .
t, In Lochner v. New York , the Supreme Court ruled this state regulation that capped work hours unconstitutional , on the grounds that it violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment .
t, Lochner v. New York , 198 U.S. 45 ( 1905 ) .
t, In other words , the right to sell and buy labor is a “ liberty of the individual ” safeguarded by the Constitution , the court asserted .
t, 6006 . The election of Ronald Reagan heralded the advent of a “ devolution revolution ” in U.S. federalism , in which the president pledged to return authority to the states according to the Constitution .
t, In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 , congressional leaders together with President Reagan consolidated numerous federal grant programs related to social welfare and reformulated them in order to give state and local administrators greater discretion in using federal funds .
t, Allen Schick .
t, 2007 .
t, 6030 . In 2012 , in Arizona v. United States , the Supreme Court affirmed federal supremacy on immigration .
t, Arizona v. United States , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) .
t, The court struck down three of the four central provisions of the Arizona law — namely , those allowing police officers to arrest an undocumented immigrant without a warrant if they had probable cause to think he or she had committed a crime that could lead to deportation , making it a crime to seek a job without proper immigration papers , and making it a crime to be in Arizona without valid immigration papers .
t, The court upheld the “ show me your papers ” provision , which authorizes police officers to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest who they suspect is an illegal immigrant .
t, Arizona v. United States , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) .
t, However , in letting this provision stand , the court warned Arizona and other states with similar laws that they could face civil rights lawsuits if police officers applied it based on racial profiling .
t, Julia Preston , “ Arizona Ruling Only a Narrow Opening for Other States , ” New York Times , 25 June 2012 .
t, All in all , Justice Anthony Kennedy ’s opinion embraced an expansive view of the U.S. government ’s authority to regulate immigration and aliens , describing it as broad and undoubted .
t, 6072 . Representative John Bingham ( R - OH ) ( a ) is considered the author of the Fourteenth Amendment , adopted on July 9 , 1868 .
t, Influenced by his mentor , Salmon P. Chase , Bingham was a strong supporter of the antislavery cause ; after Chase lost the Republican presidential nomination to Abraham Lincoln ( b ) , Bingham became one of the president ’s most ardent supporters .
t, 6078 . For example , under the Fifth Amendment a person can be tried in federal court for a felony — a serious crime — only after a grand jury issues an indictment indicating that it is reasonable to try the person for the crime in question .
t, ( A grand jury is a group of citizens charged with deciding whether there is enough evidence of a crime to prosecute someone . )
t, 6195 . Direct action also took such forms as the sit - in campaigns to desegregate lunch counters that began in Greensboro , North Carolina , in 1960 , and the 1961 Freedom Rides in which black and white volunteers rode buses and trains through the South to enforce a 1946 Supreme Court decision that desegregated interstate transportation ( Morgan v. Virginia ) .
t, Morgan v. Virginia , 328 U.S. 373 ( 1946 ) .
t, While such focused campaigns could be effective , they often had little impact in places where they were not replicated .
t, In addition , some of the campaigns led to violence against both the campaigns ’ leaders and ordinary people ; Rosa Parks , a longtime NAACP member and graduate of the Highlander Folk School for civil rights activists , whose actions had begun the Montgomery boycott , received death threats , E. D. Nixon ’s home was bombed , and the Freedom Riders were attacked in Alabama .
t, See Lynne Olson . 2002 .
t, 6228 . These include laws mandating equal pay for equal work .
t, According to the doctrine of comparable worth , people should be compensated equally for work requiring comparable skills , responsibilities , and effort .
t, Thus , even though women are underrepresented in certain fields , they should receive the same wages as men if performing jobs requiring the same level of accountability , knowledge , skills , and/or working conditions , even though the specific job may be different .
t, 6246 . The current relationship between the U.S. government and Native American tribes was established by the Indian Self - Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 .
t, Under the act , tribes assumed control of programs that had formerly been controlled by the BIA , such as education and resource management , and the federal government provided the funding .
t, Public Law 93 – 638 : Indian Self - Determination and Education Assistance Act , as Amended .
t, Many tribes have also used their new freedom from government control to legalize gambling and to open casinos on their reservations .
t, 6258 . Political candidates speak at religious centers and institutions in an effort to meet like - minded voters .
t, For example , Senator Ted Cruz ( R - TX ) announced his 2016 presidential bid at Liberty University , a fundamentalist Christian institution .
t, This university matched Cruz ’s conservative and religious ideological leanings and was intended to give him a boost from the faith - based community .
t, 6264 . Conservative governments attempt to hold tight to the traditions of a nation by balancing individual rights with the good of the community .
t, Traditional conservatism supports the authority of the monarchy and the church , believing government provides the rule of law and maintains a society that is safe and organized .
t, Modern conservatism differs from traditional conservatism in assuming elected government will guard individual liberties and provide laws .
t, 6294 . Important political opinion leaders , or political elites , also shape public opinion , usually by serving as short - term cues that help voters pay closer attention to a political debate and make decisions about it .
t, Through a talk program or opinion column , the elite commentator tells people when and how to react to a current problem or issue .
t, 6438 . To maintain a license , stations are required to meet a number of criteria .
t, The equal - time rule , for instance , states that registered candidates running for office must be given equal opportunities for airtime and advertisements at non - cable television and radio stations beginning forty - five days before a primary election and sixty days before a general election .
t, Should WBNS in Columbus , Ohio , agree to sell Senator Marco Rubio thirty seconds of airtime for a presidential campaign commercial , the station must also sell all other candidates in that race thirty seconds of airtime at the same price .
t, 6444 . While some documents may be classified due to national or state security , governments are encouraged to limit the over - classification of documents .
t, The primary legal example for sunshine laws is the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) , passed in 1966 and signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson .
t, The act requires the executive branch of the U.S. government to provide information requested by citizens and was intended to increase openness in the executive branch , which had been criticized for hiding information .
t, 6516 . The Other Founders : Anti - Federalism and the Dissenting Tradition in America . Chapel Hill , NC : UNC Press , 11 .
t, The Federalist faction , led by Alexander Hamilton , largely dominated the government in the years immediately after the Constitution was ratified .
t, Included in the Federalists was President George Washington , who was initially against the existence of parties in the United States .
t, 6525 . The Democratic Party emphasized personal politics , which focused on building direct relationships with voters rather than on promoting specific issues .
t, This party dominated national politics from Andrew Jackson ’s presidential victory in 1828 until the mid-1850s , when regional tensions began to threaten the nation ’s very existence .
t, 6597 . The twin disasters of the Great Depression in the 1930s and World War II , which lasted until the mid-1940s , provided President Franklin D. Roosevelt with a powerful platform from which to expand presidential power .
t, His popularity and his ability to be elected four times allowed him to greatly overshadow Congress .
t, 6654 . Jefferson was elected president in the House of Representatives on the thirty - sixth ballot .
t, These controversies led to the proposal and ratification of the Twelfth Amendment , which couples a particular presidential candidate with that candidate ’s running mate in a unified ticket .
t, Tadahisa Kuroda . 1994 .
t, 6723 . The increasing public political role of the first lady continued in the 1980s with Nancy Reagan ’s “ Just Say No ” antidrug campaign and in the early 1990s with Barbara Bush ’s efforts on behalf of literacy .
t, The public role of the first lady reach a new level with Hillary Clinton in the 1990s when her husband put her in charge of his efforts to achieve health care reform , a controversial decision that did not meet with political success .
t, 6738 . While domestic policymaking requires far more give - and - take and a fair share of cajoling and collaboration , national emergencies and war offer presidents far more opportunity to act vigorously and at times independently .
t, This phenomenon often produces the rally around the flag effect , in which presidential popularity spikes during international crises .
t, A president must always be aware that politics , according to Otto von Bismarck , is the art of the possible , even as it is his or her duty to increase what might be possible by persuading both members of Congress and the general public of what needs to be done .
t, 6741 . The Marriage Equality Act vote in Albany , New York , on July 24 , 2011 ( left ) , was just one of a number of cases testing the constitutionality of both federal and state law that ultimately led the Supreme Court to take on the controversial issue of same - sex marriage .
t, In the years leading up to the 2015 ruling that same - sex couples have a right to marry in all fifty states , marriage equality had become a key civil rights issue for the LGBT community , as demonstrated at Seattle ’s 2012 Pride parade ( right ) .
t, 6765 . But the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of all these issues and others .
t, Even without unanimous agreement among citizens , Supreme Court decisions have made all these possibilities a reality , a particularly important one for the individuals who become the beneficiaries ( [ link ] ) .
t, 6777 . If a particular issue or topic is not taken up in one place , it may be handled in another , giving rise to many different opportunities for an interest to be heard somewhere across the nation .
t, In their research , Paul Brace and Melinda Hall found that state courts are important instruments of democracy because they provide different alternatives and varying arenas for political access .
t, They wrote , “ Regarding courts , one size does not fit all , and the republic has survived in part because federalism allows these critical variations . ”
t, Paul R. Brace and Melinda Gann Hall .
t, 6792 . When a vacancy occurs in a lower federal court , by custom , the president consults with that state ’s U.S. senators before making a nomination .
t, Through such senatorial courtesy , senators exert considerable influence on the selection of judges in their state , especially those senators who share a party affiliation with the president .
t, In many cases , a senator can block a proposed nominee just by voicing his or her opposition .
t, 6822 . Once a case has been placed on the docket , briefs , or short arguments explaining each party ’s view of the case , must be submitted — first by the petitioner putting forth his or her case , then by the respondent .
t, After initial briefs have been filed , both parties may file subsequent briefs in response to the first .
t, 6825 . The justices consider oral arguments not as a forum for a lawyer to restate the merits of his or her case as written in the briefs , but as an opportunity to get answers to any questions they may have .

t, When the United States is party to a case , the solicitor general ( or one of his or her assistants ) will argue the government ’s position ; even in other cases , the solicitor general may still be given time to express the government ’s position on the dispute .
t, 6831 . A justice ’s decisions are influenced by how he or she defines his role as a jurist , with some justices believing strongly in judicial activism , or the need to defend individual rights and liberties , and they aim to stop actions and laws by other branches of government that they see as infringing on these rights .
t, A judge or justice who views the role with an activist lens is more likely to use his or her judicial power to broaden personal liberty , justice , and equality .

t, 6858 . Through their own constitutions and statutes , states decide what to require of local jurisdictions and what to delegate .
t, This structure represents the legal principle of Dillon ’s Rule , named for Iowa Supreme Court justice John F. Dillon .
t, Dillon argued that state actions trump those of the local government and have supremacy .

t, In fact , in response to tax rate increases , many states have placed legal or constitutional limits on regional governments ’ ability to raise property taxes .
t, The trend began in California with the 1978 passage of Proposition 13 .
t, This citizen - driven initiative capped the real estate tax at 1 percent of the cash value of property and stopped the practice of reassessing properties for tax purposes whenever a home in the neighborhood was sold .
t, “ What is Proposition 13 ? ” http://www.californiataxdata.com/pdf/Prop13.pdf ( March 14 , 2016 ) .
t, After its passage , a number of other states followed suit , making it more difficult for states to reap the rewards of sharp increases in the market value of property .
t, 6906 . In a council - manager system of government , either the members of the city council are elected by voters along with a mayor who presides over the council , or the voters elect members of the city council and the mayor is chosen from among them .
t, In either case , the city council will then appoint a city manager to carry out the administrative functions of the municipal government .
t, 6915 . Those supporting the patronage system held that their positions were well earned ; those who condemned it argued that federal legislation was needed to ensure jobs were awarded on the basis of merit .
t, Eventually , after President James Garfield had been assassinated by a disappointed office seeker ( [ link ] ) , Congress responded to cries for reform with the Pendleton Act , also called the Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 .
t, The act established the Civil Service Commission , a centralized agency charged with ensuring that the federal government ’s selection , retention , and promotion practices were based on open , competitive examinations in a merit system .
t, For more on the Pendleton Act and its effects see Sean M. Theriault .
t, 6921 . Johnson in the 1960s , that number reached 2.2 million , and the federal budget increased to $ 332 billion .
t, https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/federal-employment-reports/historical-tables/total-government-employment-since-1962 ( May 15 , 2016 ) .
t, This growth came as a result of what Johnson called his Great Society program , intended to use the power of government to relieve suffering and accomplish social good .
t, The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 was designed to help end poverty by creating a Job Corps and a Neighborhood Youth Corps .
t, Volunteers in Service to America was a type of domestic Peace Corps intended to relieve the effects of poverty .
t, 6927 . These concerns reached a high point in the late 1970s as the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal prompted the public to a fever pitch of skepticism about government itself .
t, Congress and the president responded with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 , which abolished the Civil Service Commission .
t, In its place , the law created two new federal agencies : the Office of Personnel Management ( OPM ) and the Merit Systems Protection Board ( MSPB ) .
t, 6933 . However , many agency actions are subject to judicial review .
